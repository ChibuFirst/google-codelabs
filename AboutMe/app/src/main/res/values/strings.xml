        Hi, my name is Chibuzo.
        \n\nI love \"keyboard.\"
        \n\nIn music, keyboard can be seen as piano. As the name implies, it is made up of keys which when combined together, produces meaning sound.
        \nThough I\'m still learning it, I can play western worships on key C, C#, F, F# and G.
        \n\nKeyboard on the other hand can be found in a computer system. It is also made up of keys as the name implies and each key has its own function.
        \nAs a developer, I use this kind of keyboard a lot for coding.
        \nCoding is now a way I can solve some problems and its in line with my career.
        \n\nI love eating Yam. Whether cooked, fried, boiled and any other means.
        \nTo the extent I once cultivated yam at the back of my house.
        \nYam is really my best food. I\'ll be happy to teach anyone how to cook it if possible.
