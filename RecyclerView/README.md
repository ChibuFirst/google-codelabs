# Overview
This RecyclerView app is a modification to the TrackMySleepQuality app which is made up of two screens (fragment). The first screen, shown on the left, has buttons to start and stop tracking. The screen shows all the user's sleep data. The Clear button permanently deletes all the data that the app has collected for the user.
The second screen, shown on the right, is for selecting a sleep-quality rating. In the app, the rating is represented numerically. The sleep data is displayed in a RecyclerView.
